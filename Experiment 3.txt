Experiment 3

Aim:
Creating an application in SalesForce.com using Apex programming language.

Theory:

Step 1:
Log into your sandbox or developers organization → Click on Setup → Create → Objects → New Custom Objects → Enter Book for Label → Enter Books for plural Label → Click Save

Step 2:
Now we create a custom field. In the custom field & relationship section of the Book object click New. Select Number for the datatype and Next. Enter Price for the field Label. Enter 16 in the length text box. Enter 2 in the decimal places & Next… Next… Save.

Step 3:
Click Setup → Develop → Apex Classes & click New
In the Class Editor enter this class:
public class MyHelloWorld {
    public static void applyDiscount(Book c[] books)
    {
        for(Book c b:books)
        {
            b.Price c*=0.9;
        }
    }
}

Step 4:
We have to add a Trigger. A Trigger is a piece of code that can execute objects before or after specific data manipulation language events occurred.
Click of Setup → Create → Objects → Click the object you have created ex: Book → Scroll down you can see Trigger → Click on New
In the Trigger Editor enter this class:
trigger HelloWorldTrigger on Book c(before insert)
{
    Book c[] books=Trigger.new;
    MyHelloWorld.applyDiscount(books);
}

Step 5:
Click on Setup → Create → Tabs → New Custom Tab → Choose Book → Next… Next… Save
Click on Tab books → New → New Custom Tab → Insert price for that book → Click on Save

Conclusion:
Thus we have studied how to create and run an application in SalesForce developers site by using Apex programming language.
